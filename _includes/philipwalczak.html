<h1>About me</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./assets/images/PhilipWalczak.jpg" alt="Philip Walczak"></p>
<p>I am a DDS/PhD student in my third year of clinical training the University of Washington School of Dentistry and Department of Oral Biology. During my undergraduate career, I was a student-athlete on UW's <a href="http://www.gohuskies.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=168">rowing team</a>, where I won three national championships and a gold at the <a href="http://www.hrr.co.uk/">Henley Royal Regatta</a> in Henley-on-Thames, England. In my free time, I enjoy cycling around beautiful Washington, roasting coffee and pulling espresso shots, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/philtherower">photography</a>.</p>
