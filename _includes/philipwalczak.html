<p>This spring, I am graduating from the University of Washington with a degree in Bioengineering. Next fall, I will be starting my DDS/PhD with the UW School of Dentistry and Department of Oral Biology. During my undergraduate career, I was a student-athlete on UW's <a href="http://www.gohuskies.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=168">rowing team</a>, where I won three national championships and a gold at the <a href="http://www.hrr.co.uk/">Royal Henley Regatta</a> in London. In my free time, I enjoy biking in Seattle and skiing at Stevens Pass and Whistler, BC.</p>
