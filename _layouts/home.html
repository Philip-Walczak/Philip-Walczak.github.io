    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Philip, a dental student in the <a href="https://dental.washington.edu/">University of Washington School of Dentistry</a> Class of 2021. Thanks for visiting my page! Here, you can learn more about me and my research interests and career goals.</p>

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>As an undergraduate, I have conducted research in restorative dentistry with <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/b4t/members/john-a-sorensen">Dr. John Sorenson</a> and <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/research/faculty/ishen/index.html">Prof. Steve Shen</a>. I gained experience in materials research and device development. In particular, I contributed to research on the effects of sintering conditions on zirconia physical properties and am working on a developing an implant stability testing device that improves on current technologies. I presented my research on zirconia at the 2015  <a href="http://www.aadronline.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3451">IADR/AADR General Session</a> in Boston.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about translating technologies to improve dental care. While my research interests are in creating clinical tools that improve patient care, I am also interested in the following fields:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.uweb.engr.washington.edu/">Engineered biomaterials</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://depts.washington.edu/iscrm/">Tissue regeneration</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://dental.washington.edu/research/center-global-oral-health/">Global health</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am actively looking for opportunities in the research fields above. I am welcoming to collaborations with industry partners as I progress in my research.</p>

    <h1>Current and Past Projects</h1>
    <p>In the following sections, you can learn more about my current and past projects</p>
	  
    <h2>(1) Dental implant stability device</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on an implant stability testing device that improves on the current standards. This project is being generously funded by the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/levinson/background/">Levinson Emerging Scholars Program</a>. Due to IP issues, I cannot discuss the content of this project publicly. If you have any inquiries, feel free to contact me.</p>

    <h2>(2) Effects of sintering conditions on the physical properties of dental zirconia</h2>
    <p>My first dental-related research was on studying the effects of varying sintering parameters (time at maximum temperature, or hold time, and maximum temperature) on zirconia strength and translucency. This project is relevant because as zirconia has become the gold-standard for implants, the methodologies used in manufacturing the prosthetics has not been fully studied. Since the crystal structure of zirconia changes at different temperatures and times at those temperatures, the effects of the temperature on the physical appearance (translucency) and strength have to be tested. I helped produce zirconia disks for this study, polished them, and performed quality control. These were tested mechanically and optically. It was found that increasing hold time at the manufacturer recommended sintering temperature resulted in a 12% increase in translucency with a marginal 4% decrease in strength. I presented these results as a poster at the IADR in 2015 and received a Mary Gates Research Scholarship as well. This study will be extended to test different bonding parameters and wear testing using an oral wear simulator.</p>

    <h2>(3) Anesthetic delivery device for low-resource settings</h2>
    <p>The first research experience I was exposed to was working on the development of an anesthetic device for low-resource settings. This has been done with <a href="http://bwb-uw.weebly.com/">Bioengineers Without Borders (BWB)</a> at the University of Washington. A crucial limiting factor to the access to surgery for minor procedures, such as appendectomies, is a lack of access to trained anesthetists and functioning anesthetic equipment. Our goal is to produce an anesthetic device that is affordable, simple to use, safe, and reliable for use in low-resource settings. This project started as coursework from my freshman year, and I pitched the project in my second year to the BWB group I was involved in. The group accepted my idea, and I have helped lead the project. We initially started with examining the current state of the anesthetic market, specifically looking at what already exists for low resource settings. From there, we studied reliable anesthetic delivery methods and ways we could modulate a vaporizer to account for heat loss through vaporization of the anesthetic. For this we have employed COMSOL modeling and are now in initial trials of our prototype. This is an ongoing project that has received funding from the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bioe/bioengineers-without-borders-team-receives-path-health-innovation-portfolio-grant-anesthetic-delivery-device/">PATH Foundation</a> and from the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bioe/bioengineers-without-borders-team-receives-global-wach-coulter-foundation-seed-grant/">Coulter Foundation</a>. I have recently started work leading a team of undergraduates in developing a novel, small-scale halothane vaporization device. I am excited to lead a team of undergraduates and hope to expose and mentor them in the opportunities available in a research career.</p>
