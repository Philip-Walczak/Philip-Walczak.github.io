    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Philip, a PhD student in the <a href="https://dental.washington.edu/oral-health-sciences/">University of Washington School of Dentistry Oral Health Sciences</a>. Thanks for visiting my page! Here, you can learn more about me and my research interests and career goals. Check out my <a href="https://urbempluviam.wordpress.com/">blog</a> to read about what's on my mind. </p>
	  
    <h1>Objective</h1>
    <p>My career objective is to increase access to care and prevent disease progression within oral health. I aim to do accomplish this goal as a clinician-scientist, treating patients directly, gaining the skillset needed in basic sciences, and bridging the divide between basic and translational sciences and clinic through teaching. I'm currently almost halfway through my PhD program and hope to apply for a pediatric dental residency in the next 1-2 years.</p>
	  
	  <h1>News</h1>
	<p> I was recently awarded the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwhsa/news/2022-2023-magnuson-scholars-announced/">Magnuson Scholars award</a> for my work in the Giachelli Lab. Click on the link to read a little about the award and the other awardees from my year. 

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>As an undergraduate, I conducted research in restorative dentistry with <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/b4t/members/john-a-sorensen">Dr. John Sorenson</a> and <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/research/faculty/ishen/index.html">Prof. Steve Shen</a>. I gained experience in materials research and device development. In particular, I contributed to research on the effects of sintering conditions on zirconia physical properties and am working on a developing an implant stability testing device that improves on current technologies. I presented my research on zirconia at the 2015  <a href="http://www.aadronline.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3451">IADR/AADR General Session</a> in Boston. I worked with the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hplab/">Human Photonics Lab</a> in the first part of dental school where I led the pilot study of an early caries diagnosis device/protocol.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about translating technologies to improve dental care. My previous work in implant stability and caries prevention led to my interest in understanding processes governing reactive hard tissue formation. My moonshot goal is to be able to induce reactive hard tissue formation in a biologically safe way to aid in healing or containing disease. While my research interests are in hard tissue mineralization, I am also interested in the following fields:</p>

 	<h1>Current Projects</h1>
	  <h2> PiT-2 Signaling in Hard Tissue Mineralization </h2>
	  <p> I am doing my PhD work with Cecilia Giachelli (UW Bioengineering) and Sue Herring (UW Dept. of Oral Health Sciences). Our goal is to increase understanding of how PiT-2 affects hard tissue development, homeostasis, and repair by using current biological techniques. I successfully submitted F30 grant on this project in my 2nd year of dental school (1F30DE029094-01). Below is the abstract: </p>
		  <p> Growth and homeostasis of bones require calcium and inorganic phosphorus (Pi). With millions of Americans suffering from bone mineralization disorders, there exists a need for understanding processes governing hard tissue mineralization. Pi is implicated in not only forming hydroxyapatite, the main crystal giving bone its compressive strength, but also regulating osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation and function. PiT-2 (gene: Slc20a2) is the major form of sodium-dependent Pi transporters in mineralized tissue. Our laboratory is one of the first to have identified its potent role in regulating skeleton development and mineralization. Knockout of the PiT-2 gene in mice resulted in tooth and bone mineralization abnormalities, as evidenced by reduced osteoblast numbers, bone density and volume, and impaired incisor development and amelogenesis. The focus of this research is to explore further the role of PiT-2 in cellular and extracellular processes governing skeletogenesis, dentinogenesis, and amelogenesis. Specifically, Aim 1 will confirm and extend our preliminary findings to determine whether PiT-2 is required for regulation of odontoblast and ameloblast numbers, differentiation, and/or mineralizing activity with deficiencies leading to impaired dentinogenesis and amelogenesis. A role of PiT-2 in dentin repair and tertiary dentin formation will also be studied using a molar injury mouse model. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms of action of PiT-2 in mineralizing cells using osteoblasts as an example. A Pi transport and sensing/signaling function of PiT-2 will be dissected through engineered PiT-2 transport deficient mutants. We expect these studies to provide a better understanding of how Pi influences functions of hard tissue forming cells, serving as a basis to develop novel therapeutics for patients suffering from mineralization disorders, such as osteoporosis and osteopenia. This project will take place at the University of Washington with collaborations between the Departments of Bioengineering and Oral Health Sciences during DDS-PhD training of the PI. The PI will develop critical thinking skills, learn state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques, in vivo transgenic mouse models, and data analysis that will prepare him for independent research. Ultimately, a strong mentorship team, multidisciplinary collaborative effort, and resources at the University of Washington with support through this award will prepare the trainee for a future tenure-track faculty position to study biomineralization processes. </p>
	  
    <h1>Past Projects</h1>
    <p>In the following sections, you can learn more about my past projects:</p>
	
	<h2>(1) Dental Diagnostic Tool</h2>
   	<p>I recently finished working with the Human Photonics Lab with <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/people/faculty/eric_seibel">Dr. Eric Seibel</a>. My goal was to help design a novel dental diagnostic device that may allow for high quality dental care with less cost and patient discomfort. You can find out more about this project in <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Biomedical-Optics/volume-24/issue-1/017001/Optical-pH-measurement-system-using-a-single-fluorescent-dye-for/10.1117/1.JBO.24.1.017001.full?SSO=1"> our paper</a>.</p>  
	  
    <h2>(2) Dental implant stability device</h2>
    <p>I have worked on design of an implant stability testing device that improves on the current standards. This project is being generously funded by the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/levinson/background/">Levinson Emerging Scholars Program</a>. Due to IP concerns, I cannot discuss the content of this project publicly. If you have any inquiries, feel free to contact me.</p>

    <h2>(3) Effects of sintering conditions on the physical properties of dental zirconia</h2>
    <p>My first dental-related research was on studying the effects of varying sintering parameters (time at maximum temperature, or hold time, and maximum temperature) on zirconia strength and translucency. This project is relevant because as zirconia has become the gold-standard for implants, the methodologies used in manufacturing the prosthetics has not been fully studied. Since the crystal structure of zirconia changes at different temperatures and times at those temperatures, the effects of the temperature on the physical appearance (translucency) and strength have to be tested. I helped produce zirconia disks for this study, polished them, and performed quality control. These were tested mechanically and optically. It was found that increasing hold time at the manufacturer recommended sintering temperature resulted in a 12% increase in translucency with a marginal 4% decrease in strength. I presented these results as a poster at the IADR in 2015 and received a Mary Gates Research Scholarship as well. This study will be extended to test different bonding parameters and wear testing using an oral wear simulator.</p>

    <h2>(4) Anesthetic delivery device for low-resource settings</h2>
    <p>The first research experience I was exposed to was working on the development of an anesthetic device for low-resource settings. This has been done with <a href="http://bwb-uw.weebly.com/">Bioengineers Without Borders (BWB)</a> at the University of Washington. A crucial limiting factor to the access to surgery for minor procedures, such as appendectomies, is a lack of access to trained anesthetists and functioning anesthetic equipment. Our goal is to produce an anesthetic device that is affordable, simple to use, safe, and reliable for use in low-resource settings. This project started as coursework from my freshman year, and I pitched the project in my second year to the BWB group I was involved in. The group accepted my idea, and I have helped lead the project. We initially started with examining the current state of the anesthetic market, specifically looking at what already exists for low resource settings. From there, we studied reliable anesthetic delivery methods and ways we could modulate a vaporizer to account for heat loss through vaporization of the anesthetic. For this we have employed COMSOL modeling and are now in initial trials of our prototype. This is an ongoing project that has received funding from the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bioe/bioengineers-without-borders-team-receives-path-health-innovation-portfolio-grant-anesthetic-delivery-device/">PATH Foundation</a> and from the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bioe/bioengineers-without-borders-team-receives-global-wach-coulter-foundation-seed-grant/">Coulter Foundation</a>. I have recently started work leading a team of undergraduates in developing a novel, small-scale halothane vaporization device. I am excited to lead a team of undergraduates and hope to expose and mentor them in the opportunities available in a research career.</p>
